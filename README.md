# Nitrate and Cancer Spatial Analysis Web Application

## Project Description
This project develops a web application to analyze and visualize the spatial correlation between environmental nitrate levels and cancer rates at the census tract level, incorporating dynamic user-adjustable parameters.

## Status
Under active development - Currently in Phase 1: Preparing Files and Setting Everything Up.

## Technologies Used
* **Backend:** Python (Flask, GeoPandas, SciPy, NumPy)
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Leaflet.js)
* **Data Storage (Planned):** GeoJSON files or PostGIS with PostgreSQL
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Project Goal
To create an interactive web map application that allows users to explore the relationship between nitrate levels and cancer rates in Wisconsin census tracts by adjusting spatial interpolation parameters and viewing correlated results.

## Implementation Plan
This project follows a phased implementation plan covering setup, backend development (spatial analysis & API), frontend UI/map development, and comprehensive testing and deployment. (A detailed plan document is available in the repository if applicable).
